        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever needed a good dentist, but didn’t know where to go to? That is why I propose to make a website
            for Dr. Thornton’s dental office to provide patients with the needed information before they even schedule
            an appointment. The website will contain past patient reviews, an overview of the procedures, and
            information about Dr. Thornton. It will also have the offices address and phone number so patients can
            easily schedule appointments when they need.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The intended audience for this website is patients and potential patients of doctor Justin Thornton. Dr.
            Thornton specializes in root canals typically for adults, so the age range of the audience is adults ages 30
            and older. His dental office is located in Logan, Utah, so the website is mainly targeting people in
            northern Utah and southeast Idaho. The audience will need to find out information about Dr. Thornton to make
            a decision if they want to go to him and also for contact information. </p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>What is a root canal?</h3>
        <p>
            Your doctor will perform a root canal when the roots of your tooth are damaged. Dr. Thornton is known to
            give great care of his patients. He is exceptional at what he does. He begins by doing a couple simple tests
            to determine if the root of the tooth is actually dead. After those tests and talking to the patient, Dr.
            Thornton will then explain the options available to the patient. He will always give his honest opinion
            about what is best for the tooth and for the patient. If it is decided that a root canal is needed, he will
            then proceed with the root canal. To fix the tooth, he will drill a hole into the tooth first. Next, he will
            use tiny utensils called files to clean out the roots of the tooth. After the roots are thoroughly cleaned
            out he will place a filler inside the roots called a gutta-percha. The temporary filling will then be placed
            on the tooth and the patient will need to contact their general dentist to schedule a time for a permanent
            filling. Root canals are known to relieve pain that exists in the tooth and for some is a great option for
            saving a tooth. If you have more questions about the process of a root canal or if you wonder if you need
            one don’t hesitate to reach out to Dr. Thornton’s office to discuss with them further. They are happy to
            answer any questions that you may have.
