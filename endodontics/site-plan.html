        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever needed a good dentist, but didn’t know where to go to? That is why I propose to make a website
            for Dr. Thornton’s dental office to provide patients with the needed information before they even schedule
            an appointment. The website will contain past patient reviews, an overview of the procedures, and
            information about Dr. Thornton. It will also have the offices address and phone number so patients can
            easily schedule appointments when they need.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The intended audience for this website is patients and potential patients of doctor Justin Thornton. Dr.
            Thornton specializes in root canals typically for adults, so the age range of the audience is adults ages 30
            and older. His dental office is located in Logan, Utah, so the website is mainly targeting people in
            northern Utah and southeast Idaho. The audience will need to find out information about Dr. Thornton to make
            a decision if they want to go to him and also for contact information. </p> <!-- change this -->

        <p>
            Dr. Justin Thornton was raised in Lima, Montana. While attending college in Idaho, he married his wife,
            Janet Jenson. They moved to Virginia where he attended dental school at Virginia Commonwealth University.
            Upon graduating in 1996, he was accepted into the 2-year endodontic residency program at the VCU School of
            Dentistry. While completing the residency program, he was trained in the latest endodontic techniques
            including the use of the surgical operating microscope which he uses to complete all treatments. Upon
            graduating in 1998, he and his wife moved to Cache Valley where he opened up a practice limited to
            endodontics near the hospital. Together they are the parents of 4 children and 2 grandchildren. Justin
            enjoys spending time in Montana, golfing, and attending Utah State Aggie games.

        <h3>What is a Root Canal?</h3>
        <p>
            A “root canal” is short for root canal treatment. Which is the removal of pulp tissue from the inside of the
            tooth and the sealing of that space with a biocompatible material.

            The process:
            1. The area is anesthetized or “numbed”.
            2. The tooth is isolated with a rubber dam.
            3. Inside of the roots are cleaned, shaped, and irrigated removing all pulp tissue and bacteria.
            4. Following the disinfection process, the space is filled with biocompatible material.
