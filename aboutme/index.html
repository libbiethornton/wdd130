    <p>This is my third semester here and I love it. A couple of my siblings are here with me as well which is fun. Right now I'm studying my undergrad to become a pharmacist, but I also might change my major which is why I'm taking this class. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was little. Jesus brings me so much happiness.</p>
    <p>I love to bake and eat treats! I also love spending time with my family and friends, watching movies, and being outside.</p>
